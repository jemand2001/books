<sub>this is long (?) after the team is fully established</sub>

we see jannik flying through a forest on jet-boots, gesturing for his AR headset (see: AoS 4.7 AIDA constructing the gateway). near him, mark (also on jetboots).
they're closing in on the shore, where a few people are standing, guarded by people in bulky armor and with futuristic weapons.

Janik: "Drop your weapons!" (amplified by speakers) (holds out arms with rocket gauntlets)

Leader: "Now why would we do that? i would much rather have hostages"

Janik: "well..."

(he gestures, a drone comes up from his back)

Janik: "this beauty here can drop everyone present at the push of a button, and i won't hesitate to press it"

(holds his left arm in front of him, right index finger nearing a blinking red light)

L: "isn't that a bit hasty? do you really want to kill this many people?" (gestures to the group, which includes ~100 civs, 10 mercs)

J: "i only said *drop*, not *kill* -- it has a magazine of about 200 darts loaded with a powerful sedative, developed by our friend here --"

a few hundred meters away, a big lizard-thing breaks out of the woods -- but it doesn't have a tail, and it's walking on 2 legs, and generally doesn't look a whole lot like a lizard to be quite honest.
it calls out, with a surprisingly human voice: 
"couln't you have waited like, a few minutes?"

it (or, more accurately, *she*) is jannik's co-heroine Marie Stein
