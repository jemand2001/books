# A day in the life of Jannik Davidson

## Waking up

When Jannik woke up, he knew it would be a bad day. The clock showed 10:31, and he knew his father would get mad at him for being up late. He always did.
	*sigh* "Let's get this over with"

Jannik threw on a pair of jeans and a blank T-shirt -- his father would never allow him to be seen in public with a band T-shirt or something like that. He actually preferred business suits, but had never managed to convince Jannik to wear those.
He then headed down to the ground floor, where the breakfast table had already been cleaned and his father was waiting for him.
	"What are you thinking? You always stay up until what, 3:00? you know that's unhealthy *and* unproductive. And it also means you don't get any breakfast."
	"Yes, father, i know all of this. can you let me through, please?"
	"We had pancakes! And now they're all gone, because *you* couldn't be bothered to go to bed at a reasonable time."
	"You *could* have left some anyway"
	"But why would we, if we don't know that you'll come down before they get cold?"
	"Because you like me, maybe? I know, good joke. Now can you *please* move"
	"Alright, fine. But you should still know that your methods don't have my approval"
	"Yes, i know. It would in fact be quite hard for me *not* to know that by now"

Finally, his father stepped out of the doorway and let Jannik through into the kitchen, where he poured some mixed cereal and cocoa into a bowl and mixed it with milk. He then went to the bathroom and washed his face. After looking at himself in the mirror to confirm that he was looking acceptable, he went back to the kitchen to eat his breakfast.

## After breakfast

After breakfast, Jannik went back to his room to get his phone to text his friend Mark.

JANN *hey, morning*

MARK *how's it going?*

Jannik put on his shoes and mask and turned on his headset. On the way, he'd listen to some rock music. On the way out, his father called, "stay safe!"

## On the way

he sat in the back of the bus. Jannik liked to watch other passengers, and there was quite the show today. at one stop, there was an older woman who refused to put on a mask.
	"Hey, lady, can't you see the sign?" - that was the driver, pointing to a sign clearly stating that you had to wear a mask.
	"sure, i see it - " - the woman. her voice seemed ... odd. the whole person did, now that jannik got a closer look, though he couldn't put it in words.
	"then why are you not doing what it says"
	"well you see, i'm fairly certain i'm immune"
	"then sell your cure, but please still wear a mask, 'cause there's a patrol on this line today, and if they find you, they won't let either of us go easily. plus, you're wasting everyone's time"
	"well alright then."
she seemed content with that argument, pulling a light cyan surgical mask from her bag and putting it on. she then strolled over to jannik and sat across from him.
	"you look ... promising."
	"who, me? i'm hopeless"
	"yes, you. you're clearly not hopeless, since you're not at home, cowering in fear. you've got ideas. mind to share them?"
	"well, you see, there's a distinct lack of superheroes in the world"
