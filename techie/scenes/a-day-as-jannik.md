# A day in the life of Jannik Davidson

## Waking up

When Jannik woke up, he knew it would be a bad day. The clock showed 10:31, and he knew his father would get mad at him for being up late. He always did.
	*sigh* "Let's get this over with"

Jannik threw on a pair of jeans and a blank T-shirt -- his father would never allow him to be seen in public with a band T-shirt or something like that. He actually preferred business suits, but had never managed to convince Jannik to wear those.
He then headed down to the ground floor, where the breakfast table had already been cleaned and his father was waiting for him.
	"What are you thinking? You always stay up until what, 3:00? you know that's unhealthy *and* unproductive. And it also means you don't get any breakfast."
	"Yes, father, i know all of this.can you let me through, please?"
	"We had pancakes! And now they're all gone, because *you* couldn't be bothered to go to bed at a reasonable time."
	"You *could* have left some anyway"
	"But why would we, if we don't know that you'll come down before they get cold?"
	"Because you like me, maybe? I know, good joke. Now can you *please* move"
	"Alright, fine. But you should still know that your methods don't have my approval"
	"Yes, i know. It would in fact be quite hard for me *not* to know that by now"

Finally, his father stepped out of the doorway and let Jannik through into the kitchen, where he poured some mixed cereal and cocoa into a bowl and mixed it with milk. He then went to the bathroom and washed his face. After looking at himself in the mirror to confirm that he was looking acceptable, he went back to the kitchen to eat his breakfast.

## After breakfast

After breakfast, Jannik went back to his room to get his phone to text his friend Mark.
