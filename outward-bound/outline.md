# O'Neill Cylinder - elements

following [this guide](https://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/plot-outline.html)

## Goal
- Building a large space habitat with spin-gravity
    + Other characters
        + construction workers/foremen?
        + designers, architects

## Consequence
- Asteroid impact annihilates earth, in the very far future
    + failed attempt to get one for materials knocks it into collision course
- after announcement: public backlash
    + gets worse after failed attempt to capture asteroid

## Requirements
- Materials
    + asteroid brouhgt in from the belt
        * "tug" for orbital adjustments
- orbital foundry
    + launched in parts, assembled on orbit
- workers
    + exported from earth
- rapid orbital and deep-space launch infrastructure
    + required to get population, tech, ... into orbit

## Forewarnings
- failed attempt to capture asteroid results in it falling toward earth without control

## Costs
- money (a lot of it)

## Dividends
- meets new love interest?

## Prerequisites
- tug launched
- tug intercepts asteroid
- asteroid in orbit around earth
- foundry attached to asteroid
- cylinder built

## Preconditions
- tug design
- foundry design
- ...?


# O'Neill Cylinder - outline
- Sam wakes up with the dreadful realization that a catastrophe may be coming
- decides to start building space habitats for humanity
- decides to use asteroids for material
- starts building tugs
- launches tug (#1)
- foundry construction starts
- tug #1 meets asteroid, brings it into earth transfer orbit
- tug #1 gets destroyed (fried by solar winds)
    + asteroid #1 now on collision course with earth, hard to divert
- new plan: launch new tug a month or so before it hits, rendez-vous, resume original plan from there (see also: The Martian slingshot explanation scene)
- launch tug #2
- tug #2 intercept
- asteroid/earth capture burn
- launch foundry (in pieces)
- van allen belts fry foundry section, relaunch (setback: ~3 months)
- foundry complete -- assembly fully remote-controlled
- first humans "on" an asteroid
- first plates for the cylinder
- on the ground: problems with rating a megastructure for humans
- foundry breaks down (micrometeorite hits smelting facility)
- human quarters get compromised
- rescue & repair mission: materials from earth + "good luck"
- foundry comms break down
    + can't send another mission bc/o budget
- waiting for a signal
- nail-biting
- connection restored
- party
- recruitment for who's going to live up there
    + construction goes on in the background
- approval goes through
- construction for shell is done, more workers are sent up for the houses
- 0g training starts
- first houses are done; first batch of civilians go up with Sam
- epilogue: fully populated o'neill cylinder
    + Sam looks over his creation from the hub
