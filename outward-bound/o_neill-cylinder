# Space Colonies 1: O'Neill Cylinder

## The Beginning

This day, Sam Lukas woke up with a thought: he wanted to make a permanent contribution to the survival of mankind. *After all*, he thought, *what good is it to be among the wealthiest people on Earth if the world leaders decide they don't want to play nice anymore? Or one of those rocks in the Oort cloud falls inward for some reason?*

While there were currently no signs of unexpected asteroids, the political tensions between major nations had slowly but steadily risen over the last few years, so he had good reason for worry.
Luckily, he had already founded a company dealing with space-based industry a while ago.
So, he invited the manager for that company for dinner that evening.


## Dinner

The dinner would be in Sam's private apartment, which was not particularly unusual for him. It was a relatively simple meal of pasta woth tomato sauce.
Jen already sat when Sam entered.

"Good evening, Jen"

"Good evening, Sir. May I ask why you called me here?" She sounded a touch irritated at having her evening plans disrupted so suddenly, as well as having to wait for her boss.

"Of course you may."

"Well then, why am I here?" (Even more irritation)

"I will tell you over dinner. Come, this isn't that bad, right?" (they had had business meetings over burgers before; this was certainly a step up from that)

Dinner was served, and they began to eat.

"So, Jen. I'm sure you've thought about this topic before, considering your field of expertise. What would be the easiest way to get a human colony off the surface of Earth?"

"Well, of course I have. There are quite a few options, of course, and which one is 'easiest' depends entirely on who you ask."

"Of course, of course. But I'm asking *you*, in particular. Which options would you consider, and which one of those would you choose first over the others?"

"Alright then, let us see. Which options are there? Most people would jump to colonizing the Moon or Mars first, and that's certainly an idea. But now you have the same problems as on Earth, except with worse weather and no soil to grow food from. You could also try building an O'Neill Cylinder, basically a big spinning tube with people inside. Those are the first options that come to my mind, at least. Of course, you may also want to try the balloons in Venus' atmosphere, but the acid clouds there are kind of not nice -- remember the last probe we got to the surface there? It only survived an hour." She was of course referring to the Vega 2 lander, which had found a very thick atmosphere, a type of rock you'd be very surprised on earth, and stopped transmitting after 56 minutes.

"Yes, I remember that. Now, which of these would be the easiest in your opinion?"

"Well ideally I'd want all of these -- a fully colonized Mars, Moon, and Venutian atmosphere along with a swarm of those cylinders. But for a start, I think an O'Neill Cylinder would be the best. You pull an asteroid from the Belt, melt it into steel plates, and voi-laÌ€: you can now build a very big barrel."

"Assuming you have the infrastructure to get an asteroid in our orbit, a space station equipped to lodge the workers, and a foundry in orbit. None of these things currently exist, and they will not for quite a while."

"That is all true, of course. We don't have a commercial or industrial space station *at the moment*. But we also don't have *any* infrastructure on the Moon and very little in orbit around it; and nothing at all on Mars except a few disabled rovers. I do believe it is easiest to build a space station around earth, take a rock from the asteroid belt, and make a habitat that way. Keep in mind, if you plan on making more you don't have to pay most of this cost again -- you already have the foundry and workers' lodging up there then."

"I'd also already have workers and industry on Mars for the second city there. Plus I don't have to cart the materials 150 million kilometres, which you should know very well costs quite a lot of fuel and time."

"If you prefer, you can also just cart the *workers* out to the belt -- it's the same maneuver as sending them to Mars, it just takes longer. But I think for now we should keep them relatively close to Earth, where we can send backup *quickly* if necessary."

"That is a good point. For the first permanent orbital habitat, staying close to the Earth is probably best. But we get that with a Moon base as well, so why not just go there?"

"I feel that if we're going to do this, we should make a statement. The moon has been conquered already in the fifties, people won't care as much. But if they see us pulling in an asteroid and converting it into a million residences, they're going to care."

## The Tug

> We want to build a cylinder with a wall made from a meter of solid steel, a kilometer in diameter and five kilometers in length, we need about 300 megatonnes of steel.
>
> Obviously, we don't want to carry that up from Earth, so we'll instead try to catch an asteroid and tug it back home.
> Yes, that is a long wait for the materials, but in the meantime we can hopefully finish the orbital assembly station and recruit and train its operators.
>
> Pulling in an asteroid from the Asteroid Belt is conceptually very simple: you send a spacecraft with enough fuel, attach it to the asteroid, and fire the engines backwards to lower its orbital velocity.
>
> I say 'Very simple', which on a high level it is, but you do have to keep in mind this is actual rocket science.
>
> Of course, you also have to take care that the new trajectory intercepts the Earth's orbit, but not the Earth itself, otherwise you get an accidental Mass Extinction Event.
That would be the opposite of what Mr. Lukas wants us to do.
>
> Any Questions?
>
> "Will the asteroid tug be manned?" Why would it? Sure, we can't remote control it directly with all the light lag, but the tolerances here are wide enough that we don't *really* need to.
>
> "What does the planned trajectory for the tug look like?" Now that's a very good and interesting question. It will probably do a fly-by of Venus to save fuel, if we can find a suitable asteroid.
>
> "How long is it going to take?" If the trajectory I just described fits, it should be similar to that of the Vega 2 probe, but a lot more eccentric. I can't give you an exact answer right now, but the tug should take about two years to meet the asteroid, and probably a year or two to get its orbit to match earth.

> Thank you all so much for your attention, no more questions please.

## Constructing The Tug

A year later, Sam visited the Vehicle Assembly Building of Lukas Orbital Industries to inspect progress on the asteroid tug. After checking in with security, he was greeted by Natalie, the project manager.
