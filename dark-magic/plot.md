# general

2 countries (Azuq, Ehakor) at war; speaking different languages; therefore using different magic foundations

2 girls (one from each) have to learn the other's language until they can use the opposing side's magic; in so doing they grow closer together and eventually ~~make out~~ stop the war


# the war

Azuq wants to expand into Ehakor

## weapons

### Azuq

- have tried to use tanks, to limited success due to dense forests
- flying spells (and later on, an [agent orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange) analog) are being worked on, but can't currently transport more than one person
- primary weapon: lever-action rifles powered by runes that create gunpowder and a spark

### Ehakor

- still on bows
	+ can apply some potent poisons and death runes
	+ using life magic, can be aimed really well
- plans are being discussed to simply kill the entire invading force using death magic


# the girls
