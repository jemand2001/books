# The darkness of magic [please change this aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa]

## Beginnings

Breathe.

*Breeeaaaatheee.*

Nodbody's going to hurt you.

Of course not. Who would want to hurt me?

OK but what if they do?

*Breeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaatheeeeeee.*

All right. Let's do this. I'm sure everything will be *just fine.*
I enter the lecture hall.

It's already filled up pretty well, but I'm sure half of these students will drop out before long.

"Hey, there's a seat free here," I hear from nearby. I look up to see a handsome young man winking at me. Great. I guess at least he doesn't *look* like he hates me, but of course that doesn't have to mean much. After a second though (or maybe a few more), I manage to smile back and make my way to the seat he's pointing out.

"Do I look that bad?" he asks with a grin.

"No, I'm sure you're great, I just didn't expect this kind of friendliness on the first day," I respond, "So, to whom do I owe this unexpected pleasure?"

"Johnathan Chirhan, at your service. I'm in Dual Chemistry, by the way. And who might you be?"

"Matilda Firston, Spellcarving and Linguistics"

I can do this. I trained three whole years for this. I can *totally* do this.

The gates of the city loom before me, the uncomfortable stone paving under my feet. Do I still have leaves in my hair? Better check. No, I think I'm clean.

*I can do this.*

The gates are, of course, open, and the guards seem to be there largely for show. They don't expect people like me --- spies --- to just, well, wander on in. Perhaps they should, considering they're at war with us. But then, maybe they have contrived some method of finding us out. Their magic can do some *weird* stuff sometimes. Much weirder than ours.

I try to look for any odd symbols in the stones around the gates, but can't risk casting anything to enhance my vision, since that would surely reveal me instantly. As it is, there doesn't appear to be anything special about the gate: the Azuqi on the road with me are passing through with no reaction.

After a few more moments of consideration, I decide that there's nothing to be done about it, and continue walking myself. As I pass the gates, I feel ... nothing. Nothing, except the strangeness of finally being inside a *city*. There are so many people here, and houses, and wagons, and *people*, and smells, and sounds, and ... it's a lot to take in. Of course, I *knew* about this before I left the school, but seeing it all for myself is a different thing entirely.

Well, no turning back now. I've been told to find the cheapest inn available as well as some work that won't occupy me for too much of the day. So I ask around a bit, hiding the fact I don't speak their language as well as I should as best I can. While my training included quite a bit of Azuqi, we obviously didn't have any native speakers available as teachers.

After a while, I reach an inn that looks as if it has seen much better days. The proprietor, who introduces himself as Cham Tonner, is well-roundedand friendly. When I ask if I might work for my stay, he says,

"Well, if you can fix the holes in the roof, I suppose we can work something out."

"Sounds easy enough", I tell him, "How do I get there?"

"Follow me. By the way, what is your name?"

"Emchi ..." I pause. Damn it, why didn't I think of a surname? Whatever, I think I can get away with having him address me informally. "Just Emchi."
